			<p>A service-based business I started in March of 2017. We build algorithms for daytraders, taking advantage of the processing power of machines to backtest and automate their trading strategies. Our services allow traders to validate their ideas before putting their capital at risk and avoid the risk of human error by using our algorithms to trade on live accounts. We sell products in the form of <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.supportandresist.com/products/'>trading indicators</a> and create content to help new traders and showcase our work at <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.supportandresist.com/content/'>https://www.supportandresist.com/content/</a>.</p>

				I came up with the idea for Support & Resist after having been a daytrader myself for almost two years and realizing that there was no easy way to test and validate my theories on the market. This led me onto the path of learning how to build algorithms to simulate my strategies on platforms such as <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.mql4.com/'>MetaTrader</a> and <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.quantconnect.com/'>QuantConnect</a>. Realizing that this was interesting work that I had a knack for, I started building algorithms as a service on <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.fiverr.com/mc2147/put-your-trading-strategy-into-code-and-backtest-it-for-you'>Fiverr</a>. Not long after, the number of interested clients I was getting convinced me to turn what I was doing into a full-fledged business.

				Since our inception, we've had over 500 downloads of our first downloadable <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.supportandresist.com/products/breakout-dashboard'>product</a> and a number of sizeable projects come our way (the largest of which was an algorithm that trades on 3 timeframes, 12-15 securities, and is composed of 3,000 + lines of code that you can read about <a class='business-page-link' href='https://www.supportandresist.com/content/2017/9/30/case-study-generating-levels-for-dans-algorithm'>here</a>. As a newly-formed business, we have a long way to go, but we are confident in what we offer and in our potential to disrupt the trading industry.
